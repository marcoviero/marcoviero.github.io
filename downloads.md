## Software
<a href="https://github.com/marcoviero/simstack">SIMSTACK Code (Python)</a> [Github]

Simstack is a comprehensive image fitting code to find mean flux densities (i.e., Stack) of groups of objects in confusion-dominated maps, first presented in Viero et al. 2013b.  

It was initially developed in IDL, but has since been re-written to be fully object oriented in Python. Note that youâ€™ll need the Utils repository as well.  

If you find bugs or think of ways to improve the code/algorithm, please do share.  It is my aim to make this a community tool, with community input!
