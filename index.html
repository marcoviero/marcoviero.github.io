I am a data scientist and engineer at Wahoo Fitness in Atlanta. I am part of a growing team of Ph.d.'s working to translate data analytics into athletic performance. Wahoo marks my return to the bike industry - I also worked at Parlee Cycles designing carbon race bikes. <br>

I was previously an observational cosmologist and Kavli Fellow at Stanford University.  I researched the early Universe:  from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) — when the first stars and galaxies ionized the interstellar medium — to the formation of galaxies that make up the present-day Universe. I used statistical methods to study intensity fluctuations in the extragalactic background light — a technique known as intensity mapping — to pull out signal from an otherwise noise-dominated background.  <br>

Before that I was a postdoc in the Observational Cosmology (ObsCos) group at Caltech. I did my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto, M.Sc. in physics at the University of Pennsylvania, and B.Sc. in mechanical engineering at Cornell University.  My mechanical engineering background and composites experience at Parlee Cycles were later applied in the mechanical design of the BLAST and SPIDER balloon telescopes.  <br>
